			<div class="txt t1">The common fig is grown for its edible fruit throughout the temperate world. It is also grown as an ornamental tree, and in the UK the cultivars 'Brown Turkey' and ‘Ice Crystal’ (mainly grown for its unusual fsoliage) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. <br> <span class="visible"> Luscious sweet figs are among the oldest cultivated fruits, prized for their honeyed flavor and soft, jammy texture. But did you know that figs are technically not fruits but inverted flowers, some of which are pollinated by wasps in an amazing symbiotic relationship?</span></div>
			<div class="txt t2">There are two fig seasons a year – a smaller harvest in early summer and a larger harvest in late summer to early fall. Figs harvested in the second season have thicker skins but have a more concentrated sweetness. <br>
			Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in jam-making. Fresh figs are in season from August through to early October. <span class="visible">Fresh figs used in cooking should be plump and soft, and without bruising or splits. If they smell sour, the figs have become over-ripe. Slightly under-ripe figs can be kept at room temperature for 1–2 days to ripen before serving. Figs are most flavorful at room temperature</span></div>

			<div class="grid">
				<div class="fig"><img src="img/adriatica.jpg" alt="Adriatic Fig"></div>
				<div class="fig descr"><b>Adriatic Fig </b><br><br> These pale green to pale yellow figs are sometimes called "white figs" for their light color. I've also seen them sold as "candy-striped figs" when striped like the ones pictured here. They have bright pink to brilliant red insides and an extra-sweet flavor. Adriatic figs are harvested in June and again in August. </div>

				<div class="fig descr"><b>Black Mission Fig</b><br><br>Black Mission figs are extremely sweet (sometimes they even ooze a bit of syrup) and thus are perfect for serving plain or with yogurt or tangy fresh cheese (such as mascarpone, Fromage blanc, or farmers cheese) for dessert. They have blackish-purple skin and dark pink flesh.​</div>
				<div class="fig"><img src="img/bmf.jpg" alt="Black Mission figs"></div>

				<div class="fig"><img src="img/BrownTurkeyFigs.jpg" alt=""></div>
				<div class="fig descr"><b>Brown Turkey Fig</b><br><br>Brown Turkey figs have brownish-dark purple skin, a milder flavor than other figs, and are noticeably less sweet than the similar-looking Black Mission figs. Brown Turkey figs work well in salads or in desserts where a sweetener will be used. </div>

				<div class="fig descr"> <b>Calimyrna fig</b><br><br>Calimyrna figs are comparatively large, with slightly golden skin and a pinkish flesh that has a distinctive nutty flavor. All figs have that nuttiness (which is why they're so good with nuts), but these have a stronger sense of nut about them. </div>
				<div class="fig"><img src="img/Calimyrna.jpg" alt=""></div>

				<div class="fig"><img src="img/Kadota.jpg" alt=""></div>
				<div class="fig descr"><b>Kadota Fig</b><br><br>Kadota figs is yellowish-green in color and the flesh is especially smooth and silky but not as sweet as other figs. They're good raw (they're fine, really, and if they're the only figs at hand they'll be fabulous!), but take very well to being heated up with something else . </div>
